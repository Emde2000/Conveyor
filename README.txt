CONVEYERBELT

This project is a C program for simulating a conveyor system.

To run this program press F5

This is a short explanation of what the program does 

First there is a pre entered amount of motors, this is set when the conveyerbelt is installed. In this instance its 5.6kg.

Then the screen will tell how much the conveyerbelt can carry.

In the package loading zone, the conveyer has a build in weight. 

So when the user puts on a package the conveyer will tell them how much the package weighs. If the package is too heavy the screen will tell the user to remove the package, and wont start.

The reason i choose to build in the weight, is there will always be a user error where the user will put in a lower number if the package is too heavy.

If the package is under the maximum weight, the machine will tell the user and start.
